🖐️ Human Hand Gesture Recognition Project
An interactive project that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret human hand gestures in real time.

✨ Features

Detects common hand gestures using a webcam

Real‑time gesture tracking with smooth performance

Modular code structure for easy extension

Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

🚀 Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV (image processing)

MediaPipe (gesture recognition)

🎯 Future Goals Our vision is to extend this project to control the entire system window using hand gestures — enabling touch‑free navigation, resizing, minimizing/maximizing, and switching between applications with intuitive hand movements.
